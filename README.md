# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component - SASS

![Design preview for the Profile card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My challenge was to build out a 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users are able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
